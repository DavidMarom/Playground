# The Playground Project
### A playground for developers who want to try new things and get help from others just like them

This project is a place to practice, learn together, and eventually serve as a showcase of different libraries and coding practices.
Participants are encoraged to document their experiments and share what they learn with others.

### Want to add your own experiment to the playground? good!
- Announce on Discord
- Create a branch
- Create a page on project itself and put your code there

### Guidelines
- Use branches
- Document your code more than usual
- Let the community know what you are planning on doing - allow others to join or just follow your progress
- Share your progress on our Discord channel: [https://discord.gg/g5fStjuE3N](https://discord.gg/g5fStjuE3N)
