## How to add an experiment to the playground
- Announce on Discord
- Create a branch
- Create a page on project itself and put your code there
## Guidelines
- Use branches
- Document your code more than usual
- Let the community know what you are planning on doing - allow others to join or just follow your progress
- Share your progress on our Discord channel: [https://discord.gg/g5fStjuE3N](https://discord.gg/g5fStjuE3N)
