# The Playground Project
### A playground for developers who want to try new stuff together

Live App: [https://playgroundproj.herokuapp.com/](https://playgroundproj.herokuapp.com/)

This project is a place to practice, learn together, and eventually serve as a showcase of different libraries and coding practices.
Participants are encoraged to document their experiments and share what they learn with others.

### Languages and frameworks

## âš¡ Quick Start
- clone
- run client with `npm start`

- scss - design in general

### Want to add your own experiment to the playground? good!
- Announce on Discord [https://discord.gg/g5fStjuE3N](https://discord.gg/g5fStjuE3N)
- Create a branch
- Create a page-component in the project itself and put your code there (dont forget to push :) )

### Guidelines
- Use branches
- Document your code more than usual
- Let the community know what you are planning on doing - allow others to join or just follow your progress
- Share your progress on our Discord channel: [https://discord.gg/g5fStjuE3N](https://discord.gg/g5fStjuE3N)
